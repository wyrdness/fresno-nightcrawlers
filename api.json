      "summary": "Small white bipedal creatures that appear to be legs only, with no visible body or arms. Known from two pieces of surveillance footage from California.",
      "full": "The Fresno Nightcrawlers are mysterious entities captured on surveillance video in Fresno, California (2007) and Yosemite (2011). The creatures appear as short, white or pale figures with long legs and no discernible torso, arms, or head—giving them a distinctive 'walking pants' appearance. Standing 2-4 feet tall, they move with a wadding bipedal gait. While some claim connections to Native American folklore (specifically the Yokuts tribe), these claims are disputed. Most experts consider the videos to be hoaxes, likely created using stilts covered with white fabric, as this would be simple to fabricate. Despite high hoax probability, the Nightcrawlers have become an internet and paranormal TV phenomenon."
