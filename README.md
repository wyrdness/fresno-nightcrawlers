| **Category** | CRYPTID |

## Overview

The Fresno Nightcrawlers are mysterious entities captured on surveillance video in Fresno, California (2007) and Yosemite (2011). The creatures appear as short, white or pale figures with long legs and no discernible torso, arms, or head—giving them a distinctive "walking pants" appearance.

Standing 2-4 feet tall, they move with a wadding bipedal gait. While some claim connections to Native American folklore (specifically the Yokuts tribe), these claims are disputed. Most experts consider the videos to be hoaxes, likely created using stilts covered with white fabric, as this would be simple to fabricate.

Despite high hoax probability, the Nightcrawlers have become an internet and paranormal TV phenomenon.

Claims of Yokuts tribe Native American connection are disputed and likely fabricated. No verified folklore connections exist despite popular claims.

## Notable Sightings

### Fresno Security Footage (2007) ⭐

> **Date**: November 2007
> **Location**: Private residence, Fresno, California
> **Witnesses**: 1 (Jose, homeowner)
> **Evidence**: Security camera video footage

Jose, a Fresno homeowner, captured footage on his home security camera showing two small, white, bipedal figures walking across his front lawn. The creatures appeared to be approximately 2-4 feet tall with no visible body above the legs, creating a "walking pants" appearance. They moved with a distinctive wadding gait.

**Credibility Assessment**: Low — Video quality makes analysis difficult; simple to fake with stilts and fabric; no corroborating evidence.

---

### Yosemite Footage (2011)

> **Date**: March 2011
> **Location**: Yosemite National Park, California
> **Witnesses**: 1 (Unknown)
> **Evidence**: Video footage

Second video footage emerged showing similar creatures in Yosemite National Park. The figures displayed the same characteristics as the Fresno footage: white coloration, bipedal movement, leg-only appearance.

**Credibility Assessment**: Low — Similar to Fresno footage; easily fabricated; likely copycat hoax.

---

## Evidence

### Video Evidence

| Name | Date | Description | Status |
|------|------|-------------|--------|
| Fresno Security Footage | 2007-11 | Security camera footage showing two white bipedal figures | Disputed |
| Yosemite Footage | 2011-03 | Similar footage from Yosemite National Park | Disputed |

### Analysis

Both videos are low quality, making definitive analysis impossible. Movement and appearance are consistent with a simple hoax using stilts covered with white fabric. No physical evidence has ever been recovered.

---

## Theories & Explanations

### Skeptical Explanations (Most Likely)

1. **Puppet/Stilt Hoax**
   Most likely explanation: Videos show simple hoax created with stilts covered in white fabric. This would be extremely easy to fabricate and matches the appearance and movement perfectly.

2. **CGI/Video Manipulation**
   Computer-generated imagery or video manipulation. Low video quality would allow for easier manipulation.

3. **Misidentified Animals with Cloth**
   Alternative explanation: Birds or small animals with fabric or material attached.

### Paranormal Theories

1. **Unknown Cryptid**
   A genuinely unknown species of small bipedal creature. Two separate video recordings show consistent appearance.

2. **Native American Spirit**
   Connection to Yokuts tribe folklore — **However, this is disputed and likely fabricated**.

---

## Cultural Significance

### Indigenous Perspectives

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: Claims of Yokuts tribe connections appear to be fabricated for credibility. No legitimate tribal sources support these claims. Do not perpetuate false claims of Indigenous folklore connections.

### Popular Culture

**Film/TV**:
- *Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files* (SyFy)
- Various paranormal investigation shows

**Other**:
- Internet meme and YouTube phenomenon
- Merchandise and fan art
- Online cryptid communities

---

## Analysis & Conclusion

### Hoax Probability: **HIGH**

**Factors supporting hoax explanation**:
- Only two videos in nearly 20 years
- Extremely simple to fabricate with stilts + white fabric
- No physical evidence ever recovered
- No witness accounts beyond video
- Fabricated folklore claims
- Suspicious timing with internet/TV paranormal boom

**Factors against hoax**:
- Two separate locations
- Consistent appearance between videos

### Expert Consensus

Most skeptical investigators and cryptozoologists consider the Fresno Nightcrawlers to be hoaxes. The simplicity of fabrication (stilts covered with white fabric) and complete lack of physical evidence or additional sightings make this the most parsimonious explanation.

## Research & Investigation

No serious scientific research is ongoing. The phenomenon is considered a likely hoax by most investigators.
